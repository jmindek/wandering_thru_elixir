# Wandering through Elixir

I love Clojure. Alas I grow tired of it's quirks; Knowledge of Java eventually required, how namespaces are implemeted and the lack of "it just works" tooling.
So I am speed dating Elixir.

This repo is full of the code I write to learn the basics of this functional lang.

### Cons

  * Camel case. Despite the historical reasoning, IMHO camel case is an abomination.

  * Lacks expressiveness of Clojure.

### Pros

  * It's functional. If a language is going to support just one paradigm, this is the one.

  * Tooling is great; mix and Alchemist for Emacs rock!

  * `|->` pipeline operator, simply brilliant

  * `=` as a match operator blows my mind

  * No `;`!

  * No `:` to terminate a function or for loop signature (like Python)

  * Functions that check something have `?` in the name i.e. `empty?`

Who knows, maybe it will lead me back to my original love.
Until then, I'll build up a repo with exercises and have fun exploring someones idea of their best language.
