# Wandering through Elixir

I love Clojure. Alas I grow tired of it's quirks; Knowledge of Java eventually required, how namespaces are implemeted and the lack of "it just works" tooling.
So I am speed dating Elixir.

This repo is full of the code I write to learn the basics of this functional lang.

### Cons
Camel case. I hate camel or mixed case.
It also lacks expressiveness of Clojure.

### Pros
Tooling is great; mix and Alchemist for Emacs rock.
`|->` pipeline operator rocks
`=` as a match operator blows my mind

Who knows, maybe it will lead me back to my original love.
Until then, I'll build up a repo with exercises and have fun exploring someones idea of their best language.
